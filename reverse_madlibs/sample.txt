Inside the TARDIS rages the most epic battle between The Doctor and The Master for the ultimate sonic screwdriverâ€¦ PERSONONE turns around from her place inside the ADJECTIVE TARDIS. She could hear The Doctor screaming in ADJECTIVE jealously and the ADJECTIVE laughter that only The Master could accomplish. PERSONONE ran outside where she found The Doctor and The Master in ADJECTIVE combat over a ADJECTIVE sonic screwdriver! She asked them what they were doing, but The Doctor just ran around The Master and seized the screwdriver! The Master, unable to control his rage brought about his NOUN of destruction. Shocked, The Doctor grabbed the sonic screwdriver, unfortunately giving PERSONTWO a chance to VERB away with it. Infuriated, The Master sent his ADJECTIVE Ood army after the ADJECTIVE PERSONTWO. PERSONONE was currently VERBing behind the NOUN. Meanwhile, PERSONTWO VERBing the Oods, who seemed to be under some kind of NOUN ADJECTIVE which impaired their ability to walk. Finally catching up to PERSONTWO, The Doctor tries his best to win a ADJECTIVE tug-of-war with the ADJECTIVE PERSONTWO, who thought the screwdriver was some sort of NOUN and wanted to bury it. As ADJECTIVE as The Doctor is, PERSONTWO is ADJECTIVE and won the epic battle for the ultimate screwdriver, leaving The Doctor and The Master to VERB Rock Paper Scissors over the freedom of the Ood army. Good thing FAVORITEDOCTOR was The Doctor at the time, because he knew to always choose Rock, and beat The Masters scissors, freeing the Ood army once and for all.
